# PyHTM
 Python 3 implementation of HTM.


This is a homegrown Py3 implementation of HTM. It's fairly sparse as of right now, but it's functional. I built it mainly as a way to learn how HTM works--learn by doing, right? I thought it might be helpful for other newcomers to HTM as well, since its relative brevity probably makes it easier to read than the full NUPIC library.

Shout-out to psdyer's NUPIC guide: https://github.com/psdyer/NuPIC-Algorithm-API-Example/blob/master/algorithm_api_example.ipynb I used their walkthrough as a guide while writing my code.
